JPA, PostgreSQL and to develop preliminary understanding of unit testing.

#### For DB Configuration
Please note that the passwords used for database access in this project are different from those
mentioned in the video tutorial.

#### Version Control
The standard practice of creating different branches to compartmentalize the various milestones of
development have been used. The order of the branches is as follows:

1. master: Changes were to fixes the two problems highlighted in the assignment. One, the image 
upload issues. Two, the Edit/Delete issue by non-owners.

2. features1: Changes include adding the password strength feature.
 
3. features2: Changes include adding the comments feature.

4. bugfixes: Changes include assigning the image at least one tag. And also other changes that
ensured that the test cases did not fail.

5. **final**: *[DEFAULT branch]* Changes were primarily cosmetics: Code clean up, indentation,
commenting. And adding this read me file.

#### Formatting Style
The recommended IntelliJ Java Google Style Guide was imported in the IDE and the formatting was
applied across the entire code. The link to the XML is below for reference.
